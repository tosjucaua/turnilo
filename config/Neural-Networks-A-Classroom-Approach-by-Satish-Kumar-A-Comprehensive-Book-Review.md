One possible answer is to read **Neural Networks: A Classroom Approach** by Satish Kumar, a professor of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. This book, published by McGraw-Hill Education in 2004, is a comprehensive and accessible introduction to neural networks, covering both the fundamentals and the advanced topics.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts and models of neural networks, such as perceptrons, multilayer perceptrons, backpropagation, radial basis function networks, and Hopfield networks. Part II explores some of the applications of neural networks, such as pattern recognition, image processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Part III discusses some of the advanced topics and techniques of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, self-organizing maps, fuzzy neural networks, genetic algorithms, and hybrid systems. Part IV provides some appendices on mathematical preliminaries, MATLAB programs, and solutions to selected exercises.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous examples, figures, tables, and exercises. The book also provides MATLAB codes for implementing some of the neural network models and algorithms. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of computer science, engineering, mathematics, and related disciplines, as well as for researchers and practitioners who want to learn more about neural networks.
 
**Neural Networks: A Classroom Approach** by Satish Kumar is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to master the theory and practice of neural networks. However, the book is not available for free download online. The only way to access the book is to buy it from a bookstore or an online platform. The book costs around $40 on Amazon.com[^1^]. Alternatively, one can try to find a copy in a library or borrow it from a friend.
