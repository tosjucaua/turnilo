TRITON 1.0.1 is a complete reproduction of the original's HI (Hyper Integrated) synthesis system, which combines high-quality PCM samples with powerful digital synthesis and effects. The software synth was supervised by the original TRITON developers, who fine-tuned every detail to ensure an authentic and accurate sound.
 
TRITON 1.0.1 comes with over 4,000 ready-to-go sound programs, including all of the preset programs and expansion library EXB-PCM cards from the original TRITON. You can also browse sounds by instrument or character using the new sound browser feature. TRITON 1.0.1 also includes an EASY mode that gives you instant access to important parameters, as well as a dual arpeggiator with 307 patterns for creating dynamic phrases.
